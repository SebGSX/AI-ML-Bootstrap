# AI/ML Bootstrap
Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are exciting, innovative fields. Unfortunately, they're extremely technical and can be daunting to newcomers. If you have a rough idea what AI and ML are, have good technical skills, and want to get started quickly, then this bootstrap project and its associated guide are for you.

The code in this project provides you with a working AI based on a pretrained ML model. This project's associated guide provides insight into building your own developer workstation including hardware and software, then connects you with the community's resources, and ends with book recommendations. Everything you need to get going in one place.

> Comments, suggestions, contributions, and criticisms are most welcome.

## AI/ML Bootstrap Guide
A full guide for this project is provided [here](/docs/ai-ml-bootstrap-guide.md).

## Getting Started
First things first, please review the project's associated guide. Doing so will help to ensure that your developer workstation has everything it needs. Secondly, please clone the repo, build the artefacts, and run the app to have your very own AI buddy.

## Languages and Software Used
This project is written in Python, C#, and TypeScript and leverages the software listed in the project's associated guide.

## Full Disclosure
I am not an AI or ML expert. Prior to this project, I'd never coded in Python, worked with gRPC, or touched React. I am an assembly, C/C++, and C# developer with experience with HTML, CSS, JS, TS, and Aurelia. Part of preparing this project and its docs is an exercise on my part in AI-assisted upskilling on the subject matter hereof, the bulk of which is net new to me. I started work on 28 March 2023 and completed TBC. The work was done part-time in the evenings, on weekends, and on public holidays over TBC weeks. End-to-end, everything took me TBC.

### AI-Assisted Proofreading and Copyediting
ChatGPT assisted greatly in preparing all documentation for this project. The AI assisted with proofreading and copyediting by assessing accuracy, completeness, and style and tone in terms grammar, politeness, professionalism, and spelling.

### AI-Assisted Learning
When learning, time is a vital factor. Given the gaps and other shortcomings in my expertise noted in this full disclosure section, traditional modalities of learning would have been time-prohibitive for a part-time project. With ChatGPT, I have an on-demand, cost-effective tutor that is also a polymath. No more searching through Google, Stack Exchange, GitHub, Kindle books, package code, sample code, research papers, etc; all I need do is ask ChatGPT.

Don't get me wrong, traditional tools are great; however, the number of dead ends, rabbit holes, and wild goose chases caused by the ineptitude of being a newcomer are highly wasteful. Good as they are, search engines struggle with context, which also wastes time. By contrast, having an ever-patient tutor that can just as quickly answer a question about coding as it can about the best way to phrase something, is an efficiency windfall. Add to that the ability to create effective samples and AI-assisted learning very quickly becomes the only logical way to learn.

> While AI-assisted learning is a game-changer by any definition, it isn't infallible. Just like all tutors, AIs make mistakes whether from issues with their training or biases. That's okay; just remember to check and verify just like you would with a tutor. Lastly, all learning is based on how much the learner invests. While AI-assisted learning is highly efficient if used correctly, investment of time, energy, and effort remains the determinant of the value derived.

## Conclusion
