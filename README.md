# AI/ML Bootstrap
Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are exciting, cutting-edge fields. Unfortunately, they're extremely technical and can be daunting to newcomers. If you have a rough idea what AI and ML are, have good technical skills, and want to get started quickly, then this bootstrap project and its associated guide are for you.

The code in this project provides you with a working AI based on a pretrained ML model. This project's associated guide provides insight into building your own developer workstation including hardware and software, then connects you with the community's resources, and ends with book recommendations. Everything you need to get going in one place.

> Comments, suggestions, contributions, and criticisms are most welcome.
