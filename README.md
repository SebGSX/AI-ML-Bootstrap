# AI/ML Bootstrap
Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are exciting, innovative fields. Unfortunately, they're extremely technical and can be daunting to newcomers. If you have a rough idea what AI and ML are, have good technical skills, and want to get started quickly, then this project and its associated guide are designed with you in mind.

The code in this project provides you with a working AI based on a pretrained ML model. This project's associated guide provides insight into building your own developer workstation including hardware and software, then connects you with the community's resources, and ends with book recommendations. In other words, all the resources you need in one place to get started quickly.

> Comments, suggestions, contributions, and criticisms are most welcome.

## AI/ML Bootstrap Guide
A full guide for this project is provided [here](/docs/ai-ml-bootstrap-guide.md).

## Getting Started
First things first, please review the project's associated guide. Doing so will help to ensure that your developer workstation has everything it needs. Secondly, please clone the repo, build the artefacts, and run the app to have your very own AI buddy.

> My assumption here is that the reader is highly technical and familiar with cloning repos, setting environments, building source code, running tests, etc.

## Languages and Software Used
This project is written in Python, C#, and TypeScript and leverages the software listed in the project's associated guide.

## Author's Motivation
When I set out to build this project, I wanted to do some AI/ML research. Had this project existed, I would have used it. Unfortunately, I couldn't find anything that brought together everything that I needed in one place. Out of professional curiosity, I also wanted to figure out what impact AI would have in helping me learn about AI and ML. To that end, I would like to share the following information.

### Full Disclosure
I am not an AI or ML expert. Prior to this project, I'd never coded in Python, worked with gRPC, or touched React. I am an assembly, C/C++, and C# developer with experience with HTML, CSS, JS, TS, and Aurelia. Given that the majority of the subject matter was new to me, the project presented a wonderful opportunity to investigate the effectiveness of AI-assisted learning.

For reference, I started work on 28 March 2023 and completed TBC. The work was done part-time in the evenings, on weekends, and on public holidays over TBC weeks. End-to-end, everything took me TBC.

#### A Note of Caution
Please note that using a publicly accessible AI service like ChatGPT may not be permitted by your organisation for your day-to-day job. Such prohibition may be due to confidentiality as well as statutory and regulatory compliance reasons. I am neither an attorney nor qualified to give legal advice, I thus urge you to obtain advice as appropriate.

I am able to use ChatGPT freely in this context because the entire project is open-source and I own all the IP. Specifically, I built the project using my own time, software, services, hardware, etc and did so outside the course and scope of my employment meaning that I legitimately own the intellectual property and all rights under copyright. Your circumstances may differ, I strongly recommend you obtain advice as appropriate.

#### AI-Assisted Proofreading and Copyediting
ChatGPT assisted greatly in preparing all documentation for this project. The AI assisted with proofreading and copyediting by assessing accuracy, completeness, and style as well as tone. The AI assessed style and tone in terms of grammar, politeness, professionalism, and spelling.

#### AI-Assisted Learning
When learning, time is a vital factor. Given the gaps and other shortcomings in my expertise noted in this full disclosure section, traditional learning methods would have been too time-consuming for a part-time project. With ChatGPT, I have an on-demand, cost-effective tutor that is also a polymath. No more searching through Google, Stack Exchange, GitHub, Kindle books, package code, sample code, research papers, etc; all I need do is ask ChatGPT.

Don't get me wrong, traditional tools are great; however, the number of dead ends, rabbit holes, and wild goose chases caused by the ineptitude of being a newcomer are highly wasteful. Good as they are, search engines struggle with context, which also wastes time. By contrast, having an ever-patient tutor that can just as quickly answer a question about coding as it can about the best way to phrase something, is an efficiency windfall. Add to that the ability to create effective samples, and AI-assisted learning can be a highly efficient way to learn when used correctly.

> While AI-assisted learning is a game-changer by any definition, it isn't infallible. Just like all tutors, AIs make mistakes whether from issues with their training, issues with out-of-date information, or unintended biases. That's okay; just remember to check and verify just like you would with a tutor. Lastly, all learning is based on how much the learner invests. While AI-assisted learning is highly efficient if used correctly, investment of time, energy, and effort remains the determinant of the value derived.

### Conclusion
TBC
