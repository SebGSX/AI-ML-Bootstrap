# Inference Engine
## Getting Started
The inference API is built using .NET 7 and C#. The project was developed on Windows but should work on Linux and should be editable using VS Code. Please ensure that all packages needed are install using `Nuget`.

Once the environment is created and the packages have installed, the project should be ready to run. Once running, the project provides a web API that consumes the inference engine gRPC serivce. This project is consumed by the React SPA.

## Tests
Tests are provided to make changing the code easier, which facilitates learning activities.

## Exclusions
Scripts needed to automate building, texting, coverage, and containerisation are excluded given that examples of such are readily available elsewhere.
