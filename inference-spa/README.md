# Inference SPA (TypeScript and Next)
## Getting Started
The inference SPA is built using Next and TypeScript. The project was developed on Windows but should work on Linux and should be editable using VS Code. Please ensure that all packages needed are install using `npm install`.

Once the environment is created and the packages have installed, the project should be ready to run. Once running, the project provides a web app that consumes the inference API, which then consumes the inference engine gRPC service.

## Tests
Tests are provided to make changing the code easier, which facilitates learning activities.

## Exclusions
Scripts needed to automate building, texting, coverage, and containerisation are excluded given that examples of such are readily available elsewhere.
